### Notes
While making the app, I encountered many problems that were easily solved by simple googling. However, the biggest problem for me was installing cocoapods. 
The tutorial was probably made before the release of the Big Sur on Macbook, so installation was different. I was able to solve the problem by going deep into
the files of a program and changing some lines of code in those files.
